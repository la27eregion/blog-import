The goal of the workshop, held under the umbrella of the program <a href=\"http://www.designforeurope.eu\">Design for Europe</a>, was to explore new ways to innovate in a more systemic way into public sector, based on real cases provided by participants. The first day was held outdoors in the gardens of the Ministry of Decentralization and Civil Service, and the second at <a href=\"http://superpublic.fr/en/\" target=\"_blank\">Superpublic</a>, a coworking space specialized in public innovation in the 11th arrondissement of Paris.

How to compare two countries, when the number of inhabitants of one is equivalent to that of a city in the other? Can we compare the needs of transforming a small local authority with a huge national bureaucracy ? Certainly not. Still, it was striking to see these initiatives betting on the same trend in favor of human-centered innovation and the increasing co-design of public policies.</span></p>"}},{"template_kind":"chapter","migration_identifier":"la27eregion-blog-post-2744-chapter-4","position":4,"data":{"text":"<p class=\"tw-data-text vk_txt tw-ta tw-text-small\"><span lang=\"en\">Nobody seems to be satisfied by the simple adage « do better with less » to characterize any new reform. First, what’s « better »? and what’s « less « ? In a more complex world, the more simplistic formula is often the worst. This prevents us from truly working on the basis of one equation less manichean and balanced, which comport other fiscal performance criteria, but also of others criteria with more signification, such as the improvement of the experience for the users, the added-value of the democracy, the transparency, the autonomy of individuals, or the gain on the social and ecological plan ?</span></p>"}},{"template_kind":"chapter","migration_identifier":"la27eregion-blog-post-2744-chapter-5","position":5,"data":{"text":"<p class=\"tw-data-text vk_txt tw-ta tw-text-small\" dir=\"ltr\"><span lang=\"en\">Debates still exists on the potential and limits of design or ethnology in these efforts. But we must now go beyond. Everyone agrees to say that we should not mythify these methods (Charles Leadbeater) or at the contrary, see simple additional tools in the innovation toolkit (Francois Jegou). The challenge is more to learn from these practices to achieve more structural changes in the very core of the policy process. For example, leaving the culture of excellence to grow, with officers and elected, that of ingenuity ; introducing trial-and-error zones, « crash test » as in Region Pays de la Loire, and reflexivity throughout the course of public policy ; shifting from logic of performance to a logic of cooperation and ingenuity ;  by starting from the most remote populations to re-examine the system efficiency (Sarah Schulman) ; by  changing radically the political and administrative routines, the agenda setting for the evaluation of public policies ; by thinking upscaling and mainstreaming as a viral process, network, or even as an evolutionary process (Francois Jegou, Giulio Quagiotto) ; by considering these forms of innovation such as new practices, to revalue them relative to  more traditional skills as legislation and management (Jesper Christiansen).</span></p>"}},{"template_kind":"chapter","migration_identifier":"la27eregion-blog-post-2744-chapter-6","position":6,"data":{"text":"<p> </p>"}},{"template_kind":"chapter","migration_identifier":"la27eregion-blog-post-2744-chapter-7","position":7,"data":{"text":"<p> </p>"}},{"template_kind":"chapter","migration_identifier":"la27eregion-blog-post-2744-chapter-8","position":8,"data":{"text":"<p class=\"tw-data-text vk_txt tw-ta tw-text-small\" dir=\"ltr\"><span lang=\"en\">In this context, « labs », seen as new multidisciplinary teams embedded in the core of public institutions, appear as areas where such practices are protected and promoted. They are part of these new « strange devices » which aim at thinking the <a href=\"http://www.la27eregion.fr/publications/interview-de-charles-leadbeater/\">new normality </a>(Charles Leadbeater) and prepare the public sector for a world of resilience (Thomas Prehn). The questions focus less on the principle than on the conditions of their establishment and development: how to create a governance and funding model that gives them both enough institutional legitimacy to play an active role, but also the sufficient autonomy for being hands free? In short, how to institutionalize without losing the pirate side? How to create alliances internally and externally to prevent from being isolated in the institution? Where does the work of the lab starts, and where does it end? How to better converge the different fields of innovation in labs? (Digital, social innovation, civic participation, etc.). Experience feedback exists, and most of them advocate a gradual rise step by step, by doing the proof of concept. But the community expressed the need to better share each practice, to share strategies, but also tactics and « tricks » to get there.</span></p>"}},{"template_kind":"chapter","migration_identifier":"la27eregion-blog-post-2744-chapter-9","position":9,"data":{"text":"<p> </p>"}},{"template_kind":"chapter","migration_identifier":"la27eregion-blog-post-2744-chapter-10","position":10,"data":{"text":"<p class=\"tw-data-text vk_txt tw-ta tw-text-small\" dir=\"ltr\"><span lang=\"en\"><a href=\"http://www.nesta.org.uk/labworks-2015-programme\">LABWORKS</a>, launched by Nesta, will gather in London on 9 and 10 July about 40 100 public innovation laboratories currently recognized in the world.
